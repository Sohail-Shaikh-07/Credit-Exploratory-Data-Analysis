# Credit Application Data Analysis

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **Credit Application Data Analysis** project! This analysis delves into a credit application dataset to uncover valuable insights and trends. Our approach includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and visualize key patterns.

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **Import Packages**: Load essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Data Loading**: Import and examine the dataset to get an overview.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Apply strategies to manage missing data effectively.
- **Data Transformation**: Transform and bin features for better analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore feature distributions and relationships.
- **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze individual features and their interactions.

## 🚀 Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohail-Shaikh-07/Credit-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Credit-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## 🔧 Usage
Execute the analysis by following these instructions:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**
   Ensure `application_data.csv` is in the project root directory.

2. **Run the Analysis Script**
   ```bash
   Credit-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.ipynb
   ```
   
3. **Review Results**
   Visualizations and insights will be generated and saved as images or displayed in the Python environment.

## 📊 Key Findings
The analysis highlights:
- Distribution of credit amounts.
- Strategies for handling missing data.
- Relationships between various features in the dataset.

## 📊 Datasets

This project uses the following datasets, which were sourced from Kaggle:

- **Loan Application Dataset**: This dataset contains loan application details, including information about the applicants and their loan statuses. You can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramakrushnamohapatra/loan-application-dataset).
  
- **Previous Application Dataset**: This dataset contains information about previous loan applications and their corresponding details. You can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramakrushnamohapatra/previous-and-columns-data).

Make sure to download these datasets and place them in the appropriate directory for data analysis.
