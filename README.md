# Credit Application Data Analysis

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **Credit Application Data Analysis** project! This analysis delves into a credit application dataset to uncover valuable insights and trends. Our approach includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and visualize key patterns.

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **Import Packages**: Load essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Data Loading**: Import and examine the dataset to get an overview.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Apply strategies to manage missing data effectively.
- **Data Transformation**: Transform and bin features for better analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore feature distributions and relationships.
- **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze individual features and their interactions.

## 🚀 Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohail-Shaikh-07/Credit-Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git
